Functionality

This is a learning Platform application, which is works well based on Web API. When a user opens the index file, can see three different categories: WORK, PLAY and SCHOOL.
By clicking and choosing one of these categories, we go to the second level which are sub-categories and they are more detail to make our search easier and then by clicking one of those, user can see different courses based on API result.
This is a simple but effective application that shows how API, JavaScript, CSS and HTML works well together.
